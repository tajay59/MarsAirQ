MARS – Monitoring and Reporting System

Or for a more detailed version:

MARS – Monitoring of Air Quality and Reporting System

This could be used as a name for a system that tracks air pollutants, provides real-time data on air quality, and issues reports or alerts for public awareness. Let me know if you'd like additional variations or if there are specific features the system should emphasize!
